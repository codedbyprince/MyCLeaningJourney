# My C Leaning Journey
# C Language Practice - Beginner Level

Welcome to my C programming practice repository!

My name is Sushat Kumar Prince, and I'm currently learning C language from scratch using mobile. This repo contains all my basic programs, concepts, and notes while I explore the C language.

## Why this repo?
- To track my daily progress.
- To save all my C programs in one place.
- To look back and see how far I’ve come.

## Topics I’ll cover here:
- Basic input/output
- Variables and data types
- Operators
- Control statements (if-else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Functions
- Arrays
- Pointers (later)

## Tools I use:
- Mobile IDE (like Cxxdroid / C4droid)
- GitHub mobile
